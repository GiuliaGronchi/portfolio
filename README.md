- Effectively communicated complex technical findings to diverse audiences, from academic experts to external stakeholders.

### Projects
### Ocean pollution tracking
[Publication](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-9808.html)

Developed a two-stage model for tracking deep oil spills in the ocean, as from accidental pipelines ruptures and sinking tanks, using **Python**. Key physical processes, such as oil-water entrainment and reaching of a deep neutral buoyancy level, are fully represented with a near-field plume model. This is coupled to a far-field single-parcels model, where advection-diffusion and size-dependent buoyancy are modeled using **OceanParcels**. Key model parameters are tuned for optimal fit with data from historical oil spill cases.
