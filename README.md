## Projects
### Ocean pollution tracking
[Publication](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-9808.html)

Developed a two-stage model for **tracking deep oil spills** in the ocean, as from accidental pipelines ruptures and sinking tanks, using **Python**. Key physical processes, such as oil-water entrainment and reaching of a deep neutral buoyancy level, are fully represented with a [near-field](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/NearParcels) model. This is coupled to a [far-field](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/FarParcels) single-parcels model, where advection-diffusion and size-dependent buoyancy are modeled using **OceanParcels**. Key model parameters are tuned for optimal fit with data from historical oil spill cases.

### Active Bacteria 
[Publication](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.052134)

Developed a new model for a **microscale thermal machine** based upon active particle statistical physics. The model is a complex stochastic process with colored noise that reproduces the persistence of motion of self-propelled particles, such as microswimmer (bacteria etc.) or other active particles. To extract work in a model of this kind we proposed to modulate in time the parameters of the bath, as it happens in a kind of Stirling engine. Physical processes were simulated in **C**.

### GenDip dataset 
[GenDip dataset](https://www.gu.se/en/gendip/the-gendip-dataset-on-gender-and-diplomatic-representation)

Used **SQL** querying to get insights from the GenDip Dataset on Gender and Diplomatic Representation from University of Gothenburg.
The GenDip dataset maps the man and woman presence in different kinds of ambassador postings between the years 1968-2021. This [SQL analysis](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/SQL-GenDip) identifies
patterns in time and space of gender gaps in diplomacy.

### LST for suspended particles
[Laser Transmission Spectroscopy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9359477)

Laser Transmission Spectroscopy (LTS) is a cutting-edge technique for characterization of **biological nanoparticles**. It is often used to measure dimensions and absolute concentration of exosomes, bacteria, and cells in vivo suspensions and is a promising new method for diagnostics. During [this project](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/LTS) at Sapienza University, we designed a new experimental setup with a tunable wavelength laser and developed a **Python** software tool for analyzing the transmitted data.
