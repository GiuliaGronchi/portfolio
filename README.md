# Work Experience 
## Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC)
**PostDoc | Data Engineer  (_February 2024 - January 2025_)**
- Developed Python pipelines to extract, explore and manipulate research and operational API data from Copernicus C3S, ECMWF, WDS, NASA, and NOAA. Analyzed and integrated CMCC models data into the organization’s DSS database.
- Collaborated with CMCC developers to maintain Python GitHub repository on a novel real-time Lagrangian ocean pollution tracking model.
- Created interactive data visualizations with Flourish, matplotlib, plotly, D3.js. Power BI reporting for CMCC’s policy analyses on topics including environmental health monitoring, gender equality. Defined climate impact indices for assessing urban risks in European cities.
- Coached team members and led the organization’s ocean modeling bootcamps on scientific computing and data-related topics as quality, standards and integrity.


**PhD (_November 2020 - January 2024_)**
- Managed stakeholder and functional requirements for a novel ocean risk model (end-to end SDLC), contributing to the MonGOOS ocean monitoring proposal and OKEANOS monitoring framework.
- Analyzed 1Tb+ of climate, weather and ocean data, extracting meaningful statistical insights and impact metrics.
- Organised content for technical and non-technical during CMCC’s ocean modeling and data quality webinars. Led research presentations and contributed as first author to papers and conferences.
- Balanced independent initiative and teamwork in international contexts including as Visiting Scholar at IHCantabria. 


  

# Projects
## Lagrangian Modeling of Marine Oil spills

Developed a novel two-stage **Python** model for **deep-ocean oil spills tracking**, as from accidental pipelines ruptures and sinking tanks, with a plume / Lagrangian approach. Key physical processes, such as oil-water entrainment and deep intrusive levels, are fully represented in a first-stage [Near-field](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/NearParcels) model. In a second-stage [Far-field](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/FarParcels) model (powered with OceanParcels) oil parcels are advected-diffused by 3D ocean currents and size-dependent buoyancy.

## Micro-scale Heat engine with non-interacting Bacteria 

Developed a new theoretical model for a **micro-scale thermal machine** based upon Active particle Statistical physics. The model is a complex Stochastic process with colored noise that reproduces the persistence of motion of self-propelled particles, such as microswimmer (bacteria etc.) or other active particles. To extract work, we propose to modulate in time the parameters of the bath, as it happens in a kind of Stirling engine. Physical processes are then simulated in **C**.

## Dataset querying: GenDip dataset 
[GenDip dataset](https://www.gu.se/en/gendip/the-gendip-dataset-on-gender-and-diplomatic-representation)

Used **SQL** querying to get insights from the GenDip Dataset on Gender and Diplomatic Representation from University of Gothenburg.
The GenDip dataset maps the man and woman presence in different kinds of ambassador postings between the years 1968-2021. This [SQL analysis](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/SQL-GenDip) identifies
patterns in time and space of gender gaps in diplomacy.

## High-Resolution Characterization of Bio-nanoparticles using Laser Transmission Spectroscopy


[Laser Transmission Spectroscopy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9359477) is a cutting-edge technique for characterization of **biological nanoparticles**. It is often used to measure dimensions and absolute concentration of exosomes, bacteria, and cells in vivo suspensions and is a promising new method for diagnostics. With this 6-months project at Sapienza University, we designed a new experimental setup with a tunable wavelength laser and developed a **Python** software tool for analyzing the transmitted data.
