- B.S., Physics | Sapienza University of Rome (_March 2017_)

### Work Experience
**PostDoc @ CMCC Foundation (_February 2024 - Present_)**
- Analyzed data from ocean pollution tracking models, developing KPIs metrics and automating data processing. This resulted in a 10x increase in analysis speed, enabling timely stakeholder reporting.
- Executed pollution tracking model validation testing. Managed deviations and data integrity, implementing corrective actions and producing datasheets that met user and stakeholder requirements.
- Conducted extensive numerical experimentation, optimizing model parameters for optimal fit with real on site data.
- Effectively communicated complex technical findings to diverse audiences, from academic experts to external stakeholders.

**PhD @ CMCC Foundation (_November 2020 - January 2024_)**
- Analyzed extensive satellite ocean datasets, applying regression analysis techniques to detect and identify over 100 distinct pollutants.
- Engineered Python-based data pipelines for ocean pollution analysis, automating data extraction, aggregation, preprocessing, and model output processing. 
- Trained a software engineering team in Scrum methodologies to support new model development.
