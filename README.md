### Ocean Pollution Forecasting & Coastal Risk Assessment

- Implemented a two-stage **Python** framework for **deep-ocean oil spill tracking**, incorporating plume entrainment and intrusive dynamics.  
  - **Near-field** model ([GitHub](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/NearParcels)): captures initial plume behavior  
  - **Far-field** model ([GitHub](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/FarParcels)): simulates long-range oil parcel transport with OceanParcels  
- Presented findings at [EGU 2022](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-7607.html) and [EGU 2024](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-9808.html).

### Micro-scale Heat Engine with Active Particles

- Developed a theoretical **micro-scale thermal engine** based on active matter principles and stochastic thermodynamics.  
- Modeled colored noise persistence in microswimmers and assessed work extraction via bath parameter modulation—akin to a Stirling cycle.  
- C-coded physics simulations; published in *Physical Review E* ([2021 paper](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.052134)).

### SQL-Based Analysis of GenDip Dataset

- Analyzed the [GenDip dataset](https://www.gu.se/en/gendip/the-gendip-dataset-on-gender-and-diplomatic-representation), covering ambassadorial gender representation (1968–2021).  
- Employed **PostgreSQL** queries to extract spatial and temporal gender-gap trends.  
- Shared results and methodologies via [GitHub SQL analysis](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/SQL-GenDip).

### High-Resolution Bio-nanoparticle Characterization

- Deployed [Laser Transmission Spectroscopy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9359477) to quantify exosomes, bacteria, and cells in suspension.  
- Designed a tunable-wavelength laser setup and developed a complementary software suite (**Python, R, LabVIEW**) during a 6‑month project at Sapienza.
