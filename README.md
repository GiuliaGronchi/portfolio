# Work Experience 
## Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC)
**PostDoc | Data Engineer  (_February 2024 - January 2025_)**
- Built an ETL process, extracting and transforming research data from various intergovernmental organization sources including Copernicus, ECMWF, and UN databases and drawing statistical insights (metrics). 
- Built interactive data visualisations using Flourish, Observable Plot, D3.js and other tools for CMCC’s policy analysis on topics including environment health, gender equality, and climate change. 
- Maintained various Python repositories used for pollution modeling, environmental monitoring, data extraction and processing.
- Coached team members and led organisation’s ocean models bootcamps and informational sessions on data topics, such as quality and integrity.


**PhD (_November 2020 - January 2024_)**
- Trained a software engineering team for new ocean pollution tracking model development.
- Engineered Python-based data pipelines for ocean pollution analysis, automating data extraction, aggregation, preprocessing, and model output processing. 
- Effectively communicated complex technical findings to diverse audiences, from academic experts to external stakeholders.


  

# Projects
## Lagrangian Modeling of Marine oil Transport

Developed a novel two-stage **Python** model for **tracking deep oil spills**, as from accidental pipelines ruptures and sinking tanks, with Lagrangian techniques. Key physical processes, such as oil-water entrainment and reaching of a deep neutral buoyancy level, are fully represented -> [near-field](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/NearParcels) model. Oil parcels are advected and diffused by ocean currents and driven by size-dependent buoyancy -> [far-field](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/FarParcels) model, powered with **OceanParcels**.

## Micro-scale Heat engine with Bacteria 

Developed a new theoretical model for a **micro-scale thermal machine** based upon Active particle Statistical physics. The model is a complex Stochastic process with colored noise that reproduces the persistence of motion of self-propelled particles, such as microswimmer (bacteria etc.) or other active particles. To extract work, we propose to modulate in time the parameters of the bath, as it happens in a kind of Stirling engine. Physical processes are then simulated in **C**.

## Dataset querying: GenDip dataset 
[GenDip dataset](https://www.gu.se/en/gendip/the-gendip-dataset-on-gender-and-diplomatic-representation)

Used **SQL** querying to get insights from the GenDip Dataset on Gender and Diplomatic Representation from University of Gothenburg.
The GenDip dataset maps the man and woman presence in different kinds of ambassador postings between the years 1968-2021. This [SQL analysis](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/SQL-GenDip) identifies
patterns in time and space of gender gaps in diplomacy.

## Characterization of biological nanoparticles with LTS
[Laser Transmission Spectroscopy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9359477)

Laser Transmission Spectroscopy (LTS) is a cutting-edge technique for characterization of **biological nanoparticles**. It is often used to measure dimensions and absolute concentration of exosomes, bacteria, and cells in vivo suspensions and is a promising new method for diagnostics. During [this project](https://github.com/GiuliaGronchi/LTS) at Sapienza University, we designed a new experimental setup with a tunable wavelength laser and developed a **Python** software tool for analyzing the transmitted data.
